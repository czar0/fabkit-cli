# Fabkit CLI

[Fabkit](https://github.com/everledger/fabkit) is a small utility built with the idea of simplifying the interactions with [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/) networks.

While the effort of the authors deserves some credit, by implementing the full codebase in bash scripting (I know, madness) they failed in addressing one of the pillars of the open-source philosophy: openness to contribution.

Oh, by the way, if that sounds too harsh, beware that I am one of the aforementioned.

This is an attempt to give some justice (and power!) to this amazing toolkit by re-implementing the full core in a more versatile, user-friendly and community-spread programming language.
